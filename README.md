# nostr_txid_bot

## nostr bot that relays bitcoin txid's to the mempool. 

WORK IN PRORESS 

Send an encrypted direct message to txid_bot using your favourite nostr client, containing !txid followed by a bitcoin txid and the bot will forward the request to the mempool

current capability - connects to a nostr relay, waits for a private direct message and prints the message to the console 

Once the app is at a working stage i will create an API for monitoring and other purposes and host a proof of concept in AWS

I will create a folder in this directory with some info on the resources i have used and what i have learned during this mini project
